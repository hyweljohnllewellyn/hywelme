## Fixing some Final Migration Issues 

So, this will be the final post specifically related to the migration of data and files from Drupal 6 to Drupal 8.

Further posts will be focussed on Drupal 8, specifically the Themes and Templates and any specific customisation that may be required.

Before that, There are some migration issues to resolve.


### Audio Files Linked to Nodes in Drupal 6 Did not Migrate

I am dissapoointed with this specific issue, mainly as I was expecting more from the drupal-upgrade functionality from Drupal 6 to 8.

I have tried searching the forums online but as far as I can tell, unless my method was at fault the migration of files linked to nodes under d6_upload is not supported at time of writing this post.
