## GitHub Pages Site Custom Domain Name setup with CloudFlare

Static websites hosted with Github Pages by default are shown in eht form https://hyweljohnllewellyn.github.io/victoriancarolsingershire/, with the Github username followed by hte repository name.

If the purpose of the website is for marketing a brand, service or product, then a custom domain would provide a better identity, for example, http://www.victoriancarolsingershire.uk.

This custom domain name describes the service being offered as well as the location.

The domain name was purchased through [Name Cheap](http://namecheap.com), which is great value for money for domains, though I have stuggled somewhat with managing settings through it's administration console.

## CloudFlare

Cloudflare is a [Content Delivery Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) , which I have used on previous projects.
