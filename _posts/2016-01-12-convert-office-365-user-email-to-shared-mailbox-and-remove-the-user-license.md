## What is the Scenario?
A temporary member of admin staff was provided with a dedicated user mailbox and therefore an Office 365 License.  Now the staff member is no longer required, the License can be released.

In order to keep the email for future reference and/ or for the same staff member to return,  converting the user email to a shared mailbox is the best option.  It would then be possible to unsubscribe from the Office 365 license.

## Convert User Mailbox to a Shared Mailbox

#### Step 1 - Go to the Admin console in Office 365 and select Exchange from the options to the left of the screen

#### Step 2 - Click On mailboxes under recipients
