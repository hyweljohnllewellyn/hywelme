## How to Sell?
There are many ways to sell products or services online.  

You can use affiliate marketing, where content creators, publishers and bloggers monetise their traffic by earning percentage commission for example [Amazon Affiliates ](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com).

There are traditional e-commerce where your products are sold to customers , for example [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) 

Lastly there is drop-ship, where the products you are selling, are shipped directly from a supplier to customer, for example [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com) and the popular [Alidropship WordPress Plugin - GETPLUGIN25 code gives 25% OFF](https://alidropship.com/?via=15255).

## Setting up WordPress with Woocommerce and Cartflows

The cheapest way to sell a product online, whilst keeping control of branding I found uses a traditional WordPress hosted site.

In the video, I share the choice of hosts, between [WPEngine with 3 months free](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1343154&u=2265263&m=41388&urllink=&afftrack=) and  [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/x9QKR3), the steps to install and set up WordPress with basic e-commerce capability, including Woocommerce and then describe setting up the simplest sales landing page using [Cartflows](https://cartflows.com/?cf=1614)

## Is this the easiest, cheapest way?

I would not recommend using this method, as maintain a WordPress site is time consuming and relatively complex, even with plugins such as [Cartflows](https://cartflows.com/?cf=1614) or [Alidropship](https://alidropship.com/?via=15255).

I have also found [Ecwid](https://open.ecwid.com/3B8cs6) has a free plan fore up to 10 products and allows customers to create simple sales landing page 'Instant Site'.  This therefore might be cheaper and easier...leave a comment on my [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5F4gUVgR_xs) if you'd like me to review Ecwid.

If you were selling products or services as a business to make money, then I would recommend using a paid service such as  [GetResponse](https://www.getresponse.com/?a=kEqeQTKMpY) or [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com).
