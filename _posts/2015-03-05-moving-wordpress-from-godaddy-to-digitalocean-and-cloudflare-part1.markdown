It it time for a change.  At the time, Â£60 was a great deal for the 5 Year hosting plan at GoDaddy and for that money it still is a good deal.  

However, now they want to charge me an arm and a leg to renew - GoDaddy provides a great price for new customers, but charge **alot** when you are locked in.

Also, the response time for all the websites hosted with them has not been good enough - especially now that Solid State Disks (SSDs) are becoming more commonplace with hosting companies.

I have decided try out the *do it yourself* cloud hosting option provided by DigitalOcean.com partly to learn some new skills and also they have had some great reviews.

After a quick search online I found a promotional code to get 2 months free hosting with DigitalOcean.com, so at least I could without any fees. 

As a member, DigitalOcean offer a referal scheme - please click my link if you'd like to try DigitalOcean for free:

DigitalOcean's documentation and user forums are very active and I found it quite straight forward, as a tech-savvy person to get a basic Ubuntu operating system insalled on a *droplet* . 

DigitalOcean is managed through a command line terminal, so if you are slightly allergic to the thought of typing commands, it's propably not for you.
