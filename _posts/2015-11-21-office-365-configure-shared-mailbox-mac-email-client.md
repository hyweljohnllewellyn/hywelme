### Microsoft Office 365 for Email

Email is an essential part of managing a small business.  In our experience, we found that [Zoho Mail](https://www.zoho.com/mail/) was allowing too much spam content through to the inbox, hiding essential emails from clients.  

[Microsoft Office 365](https://products.office.com/en-gb/business/compare-office-365-for-business-plans) is a full productivity suite.   The business essentials subscription of Â£3.10 per user per month provides:

- 1 Microsoft Exchange user email account - 50 Gb
- 1 Tb of cloud storage
- Online (cloud) versions of Word, Excel and Powerpoint
- Unlimited Online meetings through Skype

There are several guides to using Office 365 and comparison with other productivity solutions, notably  [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/mail/) and [Google Apps](https://apps.google.com/intx/en_uk/).

The key reason we chose Office 365 over Google Apps was that we already had a Google Email for the business, but Google would not allow this account to be *converted* to a Google Apps account.

### Setting up a Mac Mail Client for the Shared Mailbox

In this example  hywel@customdomain.co.uk is the active user with an assigned Office 365 license.  A shared mail box of info@customdomain.co.uk has been setup through [Office 365 Admin](https://support.office.com/en-in/article/Create-shared-mailboxes-in-Office-365-for-Small-Business-ecacf5b0-b5c8-449f-a89a-b7e87dcb55d4?ui=en-US&rs=en-IN&ad=IN).  Here are the steps to set up Mac Mail client to receive and send mail using the new shared mailbox.

#### Receiving Mail

1. Go to Mac Mail -> Preferences

5. Don't worry if you see the error *Unable to verify account name of password*. Enter the following:

Email Address: **info@customdomain.co.uk**  *(the shared mailbox email address)*

User Name: **hywel@customdomain.co.uk/info**  *(the user email address with the shared mailbox name after a trailing slash)*

Account Type: **IMAP**  *(POP is available, but I prefer IMAP)*

Incoming Mail Server: **outlook.office365.com**

Outgoing Mail Server: **smtp.office365.com**

![step 5 set username and mail servers]({{ site.url }}/assets/2015-11-21/step 5 set username and mail servers.jpg)

7. Your new *Shared Inbox* is ready and should be receiving email

![step 8 edit SMTP server list]({{ site.url }}/assets/2015-11-21/step 8 edit SMTP server list.jpg)

9. Select *Advanvced* button and under *Authentication* select **Password**
![step 9 click advanced authentication password]({{ site.url }}/assets/2015-11-21/step 9 click advanced authentication password.jpg)

10. Set *Port* to **25** and enter:

User Name:  **hywel@customdomain.co.uk** *(the user email address)*

Password:  the user's password

![step 10 set port to 25 username and password of primary user]({{ site.url }}/assets/2015-11-21/step 10 set port to 25 username and password of primary user.jpg)

All done, you should now be able to send and receive email using the shared mail box.
