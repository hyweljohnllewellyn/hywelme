## Introduction 
In this review, I will discuss what is good and bad about the Kia Niro Ev 2023 model after more than three months of ownership.

I will also mention charging. Spoiler alert, by far the cheapest way and the thing that makes the EV feasible is charging at home using [Octopus Energy Intelligent Tariff](https://share.octopus.energy/neat-bee-361). 

## Kia Niro EV 2023 - What is Good?

I feel that the Kia Niro has gone under the radar somewhat, being overshadowed by the likes of Tesla Model Y and Hyundai Ioniq 5.

### - Practicality - Size & Turning Circle 
For a family of four, living in rural UK on the outskirts of London where the roads and car parks are narrow, most other 'family' EV cars in are just too big for day-to-day. 

As an example, the [Tesla Model Y has a turning circle of 12.1m compared to the Kia Niro EV's 10.6m](https://www.myevreview.com/comparison-chart/turning-circle?). This makes a huge difference on UK roads, especially in central London.

The car itself also doesn't feel like I'm driving a bus, the Kia Niro Ev is 4.42m in length, compared to the [Kia EV6 being 4.68m, Tesla Model Y 4.75m and Hyundai Ioniq 5 4.63m](https://www.myevreview.com/comparison-chart/length).

You might think that the MG MG4 or Volkswagen ID3 would have been in the running for practicality, particularly as the MG4 is priced much lower compared to the Kia. That brings me onto the key criteria for our car, the trunk / boot space. 

### Good - Luggage Capacity - Trunk / Boot Space 
I did test drive the MG4 and it is a nice car, but the boot space is only 363 litres, similar to the Volkswagen ID3 of 385 litres, Compared to the Kia Niro EV, which has a capacity of 475 litres and the opening is nice and square. Interestingly, though the Kia EV6 technically has a bigger boot of 480 litres, I found the shape of the opening not so practical. [Reference for luggage capacity](https://www.myevreview.com/comparison-chart/luggage-capacity).

The key criteria for us selecting the car was can the car fit a pedal harp? Granted, this is a relatively unique ask of a car, but the question [which cars can carry a pedal harp](https://harp.fandom.com/wiki/Transporting_a_Pedal_Harp_by_Car) has been asked before. 

In fact as part of a test drive, we took the car into central London to a harp shop to ensure a harp would fit!

### Good - Vehicle to Load
I really like the idea of the car being a mobile battery.

In the UK as of 2023, There are surprisingly few EV cars having an ability to use the battery to charge other things. I was surprised that neither Tesla nor Volkswagen have this feature available. Note that Volkswagen have mentioned making this available, but yet to make it real. See [bidirectional-cars-2023](https://www.dcbel.energy/blog/2023/01/04/new-year-new-bidirectional-cars-2023-edition/) for a list of cars with bi-directional charging as of January 2023. [This](https://zecar.com/resources/which-electric-cars-have-bidirectional-charging) is also useful reference.
 
The Kia Niro EV (level 3 and 4 trim in UK) come with this option, which effectively provides a 3-pin plug as standard, allowing drivers to power appliances directly from the car, with a maximum load up to 3.6kW.

This has been useful for plugging a laptop into the internal plug, located below the rear seats, giving a mobile office.

I am really looking forward to using it in the winter to power my laundry tumble dryer.

I just wish that I could power my entire home. With a 64kWh battery, the Kia Niro EV could power my home for almost a week.

### Good - Driver Assist
One of the best things about the car is the heads up display, which along with auto highway assist adaptive cruise control and built-in navigation with live traffic data makes driving on the motorway almost relaxing.  Unlike [Kia Connect](https://www.kia.com/uk/dealers/citygatehighwycombe/owners/telematics/#:~:text=YOUR%20FREE%20SEVEN%2DYEAR%20CONNECTED,digital%20features%20in%20your%20car), which is free for 7 years in the UK,  [Tesla charge £9.99 monthly for live traffic data](https://www.tesla.com/en_gb/support/connectivity).

In fact, after a 200 mile journey to Wales on the M4, I needed to remind myself that I was actually the driver, when eventually I came off the motorway.

## Kia Niro EV 2023 - What is Bad?
Like most new, more premium that it expensive cars, they suffer from having too much technology.  Sometimes, a button is better, and if there is a button, it should do what it says, and the human driver should be more in control, not the car!

Electric cars could be really simple, but somehow they're not, and the Kia Niro EV is no exception. If you find your mobile phone frustrating, just try an EV!

### Bad - Driver Assist
The car is constantly beeping and pulls the steering wheel if it thinks that my driving is not up to scratch. In the UK, with our narrow road lanes , the lane keep assist gets really annoying very quickly, and can make it harder to drive safely. It is often a relief to get into an older car without any 'driver assistance' technology.

### Bad - Heating and Range in Cold Weather
It is well known that the range of an EV drops in cold weather, but my Kia Niro EV, specified with a £700 optional heat pump travelled only 200 miles on a full charge in January on a trip to Wales averaging 3.1miles/kWh.  Granted, most of this was motorway driving, but given the claimed [up to 285 mile range](https://www.kia.com/uk/new-cars/niro/), I was disappointed.

As of May 2023, it is worth noting that the average miles per kilowatt-hour is now more like 4.1.  Temperature has a huge impact on range of EVs in 2023.

Mentioning the heat pump, it is worth saying that the internal heating controls are bad.  When setting the temperature to say 24 degrees Celsius, the car sometimes does not head at all, even after 20 minutes.

This might be a fault with the specific car, but the only way t make the heating work consistently is by using the 'auto climate' button. Apparently, just setting the temperature and turning on the fan/ blower is not enough.

### Bad - Home Charging Efficiency - why it costs more? 
When charging at home using a 7kWh charger, the best efficiency I have achieved is 88%. To make that clear, for evert 1kW added to the car, it takes 1.14kW of energy. 

To achieve this efficiency, I needed to charge the battery from 40% to 80%, with the battery pre-conditioning turned off. 

In fact when charging the battery from [67% to 79% in February 2023, the Kia Niro EV 2023 wasted 40% of the energy](https://twitter.com/messageHal/status/1629417981716443137?s=20). This seems wrong.  I even tweeted at Kia UK.

I really think that car manufacturers should improve this, and like when buying a fridge, cars should have a rating to indicate its charging efficiency as well as its range efficiency.

### Bad - Glitches
There are driver profiles that can be set in the car. Sometimes, randomly, the car seems to get these 'mixed up' and the only way to recover is by using a pointy thing to reset the entertainment system.


## Cheapest way to Charge Kia Niro EV 2023 - Octopus Energy and Electroverse
It is a sad fact that the public charging network is woefully expensive and lacking in the UK. 

Without a driveway and 7kWh home charger, it would not be financially practical to own an EV in my opinion in 2023.

Using [Octopus Energy](https://share.octopus.energy/neat-bee-361) and their Intelligent EV tariff, the car (and home) can use electricity at a rate of 7.5p/ kWh between 23:30 and 05:30 (as of May 2023)

Also, when using their [Electroverse](https://electroverse.octopus.energy/sign-up?referralCode=neat-bee-361) app, the bill is consolidated along with my home energy making it simple. Best of all, most EV chargers through Electroverse offer an 8% discount for an Intelligent Octopus user.

Get £50 credit when you sign up to [Octopus Energy using my referral](https://share.octopus.energy/neat-bee-361). A disclosure that I will also receive £50.

Get £25 when you sign up to [Octopus Electroverse using my referral and you complete one charge](https://electroverse.octopus.energy/sign-up?referralCode=neat-bee-361). A disclosure that I will also receive £25.
