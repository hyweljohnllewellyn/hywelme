## Why Use a Custom Domain Name 

Static websites hosted with Github Pages by default are shown in eht form https://hyweljohnllewellyn.github.io/victoriancarolsingershire/, with the Github username followed by hte repository name.

If the purpose of the website is for marketing a brand, service or product, then a custom domain would provide a better identity, for example, http://www.victoriancarolsingershire.uk.

This custom domain name describes the service being offered as well as the location.

The domain name was purchased through [Name Cheap](http://namecheap.com), which is great value for money for domains, though I have stuggled somewhat with managing settings through it's administration console.

Therefore, I generally use Cloudflare, which is a [Content Delivery Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) to administer [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) settings.

## GitHub Pages Custom Domain Names

GitHub allows the configring of Apex Domains, for example http://victoriancarolsingershire.uk i.e without the _'www'_, however  GitHub recommends using a subdomain, for example http://www.victoriancarolsingershire.uk, i.e with the _'www'_, as described by GitHub at [About Custom Domains](https://help.github.com/articles/about-custom-domains-for-github-pages-sites/).  Briefly, using GitHub Pages subdomains will make the pages load faster.
