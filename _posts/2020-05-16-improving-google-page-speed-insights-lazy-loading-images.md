## What is Lazy Loading Images?
â€‹
Lazy loading images is a way to only load the image when the user can see it on their browser, that is when it is "on screen".  It means that the page will , or should load faster, paricularly on mobile devices where bandwidth is limited.  Google developers offer more insight.  This blog talks about native lazy loading in the browser and different attributes https://addyosmani.com/blog/lazy-loading/.

Before applying lazy loading of images to the test page, it achieved a mobile page speed score of 92, which is actually very good. Can lazy loading improve on this?
