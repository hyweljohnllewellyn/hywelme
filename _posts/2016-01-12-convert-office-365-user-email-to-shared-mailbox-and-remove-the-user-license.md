title: Convert Office 365 User Email to Shared Mailbox and Remove the User License
---


# What is the Scenario?
During peak trade, a temporary member of admin staff was needed, so it was required to create a dedicated user mailbox and therefore an Office 365 License.
In order to keep the emails for future reference and/ or for the same staff member to return,  converting the user email to a shared mailbox was the best option.  Then it would be possible to unsubscribe from the Office 365 license.

## Convert User Mailbox to a Shared Mailbox

####Step 1 - Go to the Admin console in Office 365 and select Exchange from the options to the left of the screen

####Step 2 - Click On mailboxes under reciptients

####Step 8 - In the Admin console of Office 365, select Subscriptions under the Billing option on the left of the screen.  Then click Add/Remove users.  Notice that there are currently two purchased, and one assigned.

This subscription's quantity was successfully updated.  Done!

Note that you could now provide access to the new shared mailbox to other users,  see [Open and Used a Shared Mailbox](https://support.office.com/en-my/article/Open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-Outlook-Web-App-bc127866-42be-4de7-92ae-1ef2f787fd5c?ui=en-US&rs=en-MY&ad=MY#__migbm_0).
