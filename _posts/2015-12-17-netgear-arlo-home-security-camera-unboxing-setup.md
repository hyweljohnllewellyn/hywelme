title: Netgear Arlo Home Security Camera Unboxing and Basic Setup

##Some Research

Following online research of home security camera options, I had narrowed my choices to Nest and Arlo.  One thing I had found was that all cameras pretty much seem to require the user to sign up to a subscription cloud service in order to view recorded video.  These services start from about £8 / month, so this extra cost should be considered when making a decision.

As Arlo currently comes with a free basic service, providing 1Gb storage, 10 days history and up to 5 cameras, this was good enough - even though the camera has a higher initial cost.  

Note that the key downsides to Arlo are that there is no microphone or speaker, so you cannot hear or speak - so as a baby or pet monitor, the Arlo may not be the best choice.

I eventually bought the 2-camera package for £279.99 at [PC World Arlo Camera](http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/smart-tech/smart-tech/smart-home/smart-home-monitoring-and-power/netgear-arlo-smart-home-security-system-10125398-pdt.html?gclid=CjwKEAiA18mzBRCo1e_-y_KLpXISJACEsANGZ_90KxxzCCYcAMPsuoIdvKzYpJ5t-Tzy4RiGtLZ2ZxoCzrfw_wcB&srcid=198&cmpid=ppc~gg~~~Exact&mctag=gg_goog_7904&s_kwcid=AL!3391!3!68396508140!!!g!114416079860!&istCompanyId=9a35962d-802d-4e67-9721-0a3328ca1f02&istItemId=ltpxmmqxr&istBid=tztx&ef_id=VgB68AAAAda8ZfDl:20151217142418:s)

##Unboxing
Here is the boxed arlo smart home security two camera system:
![arlo smart home security camera boxed]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2015-12-17/1 arlo smart home security camera boxed.jpg)

####Contents 1
- US power plug with UK and EU adapter
- Ethernet cable
- Wall plugs
![arlo unboxed contents]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2015-12-17/2 arlo unboxed contents.jpg)

####Contents 2
- 8 lithium 123 batteries _(notice the extra battery compartment for systems with a third camera)_
- 4 wall mounts )I thought providing extra mounts, was very useful as the rear of the cameras are magnetic and so could easily be moved to alternative mounts as required)

####Contents 3
- the netgear base station for the cameras

####Contents 4
- the two cameras - notice the standard camera mount at the base of the cameras, that could be used as an alternative to the magnetic mount

As there were no instructions included I Used [http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/arlo/Arlo_UM_02Oct2015.pdf](http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/arlo/Arlo_UM_02Oct2015.pdf "Arlo Instructions Oct 2015").  The instructions were very clear and it worked...

##Connect Base Station to Router and Register Account

####Connect Base Station to home or work router
So, following the instructions, I connected the base station directly to a free ethernet port on my BT Home Hub 3 and then powered on the base station.

####Arlo Login Page
Next, was to register an account at arlo.com/login:

####System Setup Page
Amazingly, the browser defaulted the base station serial number, I just selected my timezone.

####Account Setup Page
Just some basic information required for the account setup

####Service Selection Page
Next the all important service selection.  I selected the free Basic plan.

##Sync Cameras to Base Station

####A Insert Batteries
Slightly tricky to open the battery compartment as there is a lock and it slides out and then hinges up... here are the batteries...

####B Press the Base Station Sync Button
Note that the instructions mention that the sync status LED should light up - it did not for me, though strategy the USB light lit up... regardless, I continued with the next step

####C Press the Camera Sync Button

I repeated steps A to D for the second camera

####Base Station with Camera Sync Light

That's it..I will describe some more advanced configuration in an upcoming post.  I would recommend these little cameras for usability..
