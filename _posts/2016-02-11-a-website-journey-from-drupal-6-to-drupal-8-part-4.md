## [Preparing an upgrade to Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/node/2350603)

According to this link, the requirements are:

> A fresh installation of Drupal 8 with the core module Migrate Drupal enabled.

> The Migrate Upgrade module installed and enabled on the Drupal 8 site.

> If you plan on running the upgrade from Drush, youâ€™ll need Drush 8.

These are covered in [Part 1](http://www.hywel.me/drupal/2016/02/06/a-website-journey-from-drupal-6-to-drupal-8-part-1.html) and [Part 2](http://www.hywel.me/drupal/2016/02/07/a-website-journey-from-drupal-6-to-drupal-8-part-2.html). Screenshot showing enabled modules in Drupal 8:

> Access to the Drupal 6 or 7 database from the host where your new Drupal 8 site is.

> Access to the source site's files.

The Drupal upgrade will be carried out locally on a Mac.  The Drupal 6 database and files are locally installed.

> Enable required modules.  The migration process does not install modules on the Drupal 8 destination site and only migrations relevant for modules installed on both the source and destination site are run. Therefore prior to running the migration, you need to enable all modules on the Drupal 8 site for which you want configuration and content upgraded from the source site

The above statement is a bit confusing, and suggests that it is necessary to identify all Modules used in Drupal 6, their equivalent in Drupal 8 and install them in Drupal 8 prior to upgrade.  In [Part 3](http://www.hywel.me/drupal/2016/02/10/a-website-journey-from-drupal-6-to-drupal-8-part-3.html), I carried our a cursory analysis of the modules and installed an XML sitemap module.

## [Executing an upgrade using Drush](https://www.drupal.org/node/2350651)

> For more control, you will probably want to pass the --configure-only option to migrate-upgrade, so it will only perform the first step of creating the migrations.

{% highlight bash %}
cd /Users/hywel/Sites/drupal8
drush migrate-upgrade --legacy-db-url=mysql://hartleyvoicescms:MTwGCDT5Ah74smSW@localhost/hartleyvoicescms --legacy-root=/Users/hywel/Sites/hartleyvoicescms --configure-only
{% endhighlight %}

Nothing much happened, it just returned to the prompt.  To some extent, this was expected as the configure-only option was used.  So next was:

{% highlight bash %}
drush migrate-status
{% endhighlight %}

This was a bit more interesting and summarised what migration was available from Drupal 6.
