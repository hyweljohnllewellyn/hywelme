## Prose.io and Jekyll Static Sites

**[Prose.io](http://prose.io)** is a web application that allows editing of Github Repositories through a broswer.  This has great potential, particularly when used with the website hosting offered by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), providing *a CMS-like experience for a generated static site*, as described by [Daniel Nabb](http://blog.crushingpennies.com/a-static-site-generator-with-gulp-proseio-and-travis-ci.html).

Prose.io has some poweful configuration capability to simplify the user editing experience, which I will be exploring in upcoming posts.  

The basic prose configuration is added to the _config.yml file of my Jekyll site

{% highlight yaml %}
prose:
  rooturl: ''
  siteurl: 'http://www.hywel.me'
  media: 'assets'
  metadata:
    _posts:
      - name: "layout"
        field:
          label: "layout"
          element: "text"
          value: "post"
      - name: "date"
        field:
          label: "date"
          element: "text"
          value: "CURRENT_DATETIME"
      - name: "author"
        field:
          label: "author"
          element: "text"
          value: "Hywel"
      - name: "categories"
        field:
          label: "categories"
          element: "text"
          placeholder: "Enter categories"
      - name: "excerpt"
        field:
          label: "excerpt"
          element: "text"
          placeholder: "Enter excerpt"
      - name: "meta"
        field:
          label: "meta"
          element: "text"
          placeholder: "Enter metadata"
      {% endhighlight %}


Note that I have defined my media folder with today's date.  I keep my media sorted into date folders.  I have not found out how to configure this as yet.
