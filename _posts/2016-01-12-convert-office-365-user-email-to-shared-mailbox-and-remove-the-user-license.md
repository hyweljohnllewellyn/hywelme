title: Convert Office 365 User Email to Shared Mailbox and Remove the User License
---

# What is the Scenario?
During peak trade, a temporary member of admin staff was needed, so it was required to create a dedicated user mailbox and therefore an Office 365 License.
In order to keep the emails for future reference and/ or for the same staff member to return,  converting the user email to a shared mailbox was the best option.  Then it would be possible to unsubscribe from the Office 365 license.

## Convert User Mailbox to a Shared Mailbox
###Step 1 - Go to the Admin console in Office 365 and select Exchange from the options to the left of the screen

###Step 2 - Click On Recipients and select the User Mailbox to be converted

###Step 3 - Click On Convert under the Convert to Shared Mailbox option to the right of the screen.  A warning will be shown, click Yes to continue.

###Step 4 - Your regular mailbox has been converted into shared mailbox.  Click Close to continue.   

## Remove Unused Office 365 License
###Step 5 - Go to the Admin console in Office 365 and Select Active Users under the Users option on the left 

###Step 6 - Select the User and Click Edit under Assigned license on the right of the screen

###Step 7 - Uncheck the Office 365 Business Essentials license and Click Save 

###Step 8 - Go to the Admin console in Office 365 and select Subscriptions under the Billing option on the left of the screen

###Step 9 - Click Add/Remove users and reduce the number of Total licenses by 1 (notice that there are currently two purchased, and one assigned)

###Step 10 - Click Submit to confirm

This subscription's quantity was successfully updated.  Done!
Note that you could now provide access to the new shared mailbox to other users see [Open and Used a Shared Mailbox](https://support.office.com/en-my/article/Open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-Outlook-Web-App-bc127866-42be-4de7-92ae-1ef2f787fd5c?ui=en-US&rs=en-MY&ad=MY#__migbm_0).
