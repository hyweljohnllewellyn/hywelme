## [Preparing an upgrade to Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/node/2350603)


According to this link, the requirements are:

> A fresh installation of Drupal 8 with the core module Migrate Drupal enabled.

> The Migrate Upgrade module installed and enabled on the Drupal 8 site.

> If you plan on running the upgrade from Drush, youâ€™ll need Drush 8.

Check.  These covered in [Part 1](http://www.hywel.me/drupal/2016/02/06/a-website-journey-from-drupal-6-to-drupal-8-part-1.html) and [Part 2](http://www.hywel.me/drupal/2016/02/07/a-website-journey-from-drupal-6-to-drupal-8-part-2.html). Screenshot showing enabled modules in Drupal 8:

> Access to the Drupal 6 or 7 database from the host where your new Drupal 8 site is.

> Access to the source site's files.

The Drupal upgrade will be carried out locally on a Mac.  The Drupal 6 database and files are locally installed.
