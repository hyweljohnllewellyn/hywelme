## Basic Research

Following online research of home security camera options, I had narrowed my choices to Nest and Arlo.  One thing I had found was that all cameras pretty much seem to require the user to sign up to a subscription cloud service in order to view recorded video.  These services start from about £8 / month, so this extra cost should be considered when making a decision.

As Arlo currently comes with a free basic service, providing 1Gb storage, 10 days history and up to 5 cameras, this was good enough - even though the camera has a higher initial cost.  

Note that the key downsides to Arlo are that there is no microphone or speaker, so you cannot hear or speak - so as a baby or pet monitor, the Arlo may not be the best choice.

I eventually bought the 2-camera package for £279.99 at [PC World Arlo Camera](http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/smart-tech/smart-tech/smart-home/smart-home-monitoring-and-power/netgear-arlo-smart-home-security-system-10125398-pdt.html?gclid=CjwKEAiA18mzBRCo1e_-y_KLpXISJACEsANGZ_90KxxzCCYcAMPsuoIdvKzYpJ5t-Tzy4RiGtLZ2ZxoCzrfw_wcB&srcid=198&cmpid=ppc~gg~~~Exact&mctag=gg_goog_7904&s_kwcid=AL!3391!3!68396508140!!!g!114416079860!&istCompanyId=9a35962d-802d-4e67-9721-0a3328ca1f02&istItemId=ltpxmmqxr&istBid=tztx&ef_id=VgB68AAAAda8ZfDl:20151217142418:s)
