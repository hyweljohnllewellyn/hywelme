## Unlimited Cloud Storage on your Device - Not Quite Yet

In my previous post on [Unlimited Device Storage Space]({{site.baseurl}}/cloud/storage/2016/07/27/unlimited-storage-space-for-your-device.html), I installed the new service from [Upthere.com](https://upthere.com/) onto my Mac.  The service promises to write data directly to the cloud - in theory meaning your device has virtually unlimited storage available.  

However, currently, the Upthere service is much like any other - needing to synchronise your device or PC to their cloud.   

During _beta_, Upthere provided a camera app that would write photos directly to the Upthere storage, but it seems to have been discontinued as posted in [so long for now from upthere camera](http://shutdownlikeaboss.com/post/146893037120/so-long-for-now-from-upthere-camera):

I wrote to the Upthere support team and this was their response:

Hi Hywel, 
Upthere camera is a feature that is currently being worked on and will be available to users at some point in the future. In the meantime you will have to delete pictures that you have uploaded manually from the phone. Hope this helps!

I guess the promise of unlimited device storage is _"at some point in the future"_.  It is just a matter of time.

## Upthere Android App Installation

## Upthere Android App First Impressions

A good feature is Flow, showing your most recent activity:

![upthere flow mobile recent activity mobile android.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2016-07-30/upthere flow mobile recent activity mobile android.jpg)

There is a potential to import your Music library to stream from the cloud in high fidelity:

![upthere stream music.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2016-07-30/upthere stream music.jpg)

I did allow the app to connect to my device's Gallery, but when I realised it was importing over 1000 photos and videos, I tried to cancel by unselecting the _Connect your gallery option_

![U there gallery sync turned off.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2016-07-30/U there gallery sync turned off.jpg)

This option seemed to have no effect.

This possible bug and the fact that I could not the Upthere service to save camera photos direct to the cloud meant that it was not for me. 

I will certainly be keen to try their service again - when they have a camera app - Until then I will continue to look other providers such as [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/) or [Apple iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/).
