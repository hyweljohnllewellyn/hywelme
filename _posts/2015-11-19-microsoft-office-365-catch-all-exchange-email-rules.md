[Microsoft Office 365 Business Essentials](https://products.office.com/en-gb/business/compare-office-365-for-business-plans) costs from Â£3.10 per 'Exchange' user per month

An 'Exchange' user is a single email account for a specified domain, with 50 Gb of storage and highly configurable mail server rules.  

Some mail providers provide multiple email accounts for a given domain, so Office 365 can get quite expensive with multiple users, just for email.  

Though it has to be said - the email service we have experienced for the last 4 months from Office 365 has been great for spam protection and reliability.  You get what you pay for.

Office 365 **does not** support [catch-all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-all), that is email addresses not specifically defined in the mail server.

Exchange mail flow rules can be used to re-direct email addresses to a specified email.   Note that this is distinct to a shared mailbox, which appears as a separate mail box from the user.  Setting up shared mailboxes on Office 365 will be described in an upcoming post.

For this example, the 'Exchange' user will be hywel@customdomain.co.uk.  Alternative 'catch-all' email addresses for howell@customdomain.co.uk and contact@customdomain.co.uk will be configured.

1. From the Office 365 admin center, select 'CONTACTS', click the plus icon  to add howell@customdomain.co.uk as a contact.  Repeat for contact@customdomain.co.uk.
2. Next, select 'ADMIN' -> 'Exchange' to go the Exchange admin center.
3. Select mail flow , then rules and click the plus icon and select 'Create a new rule..'
4. In the *Apply rule if...* option select 'The recipient is...'
5. Select the email addresses howell@customdomain.co.uk and contact@customdomain.co.uk to be re-directed
6.  In the *Do the following...* option select 'Redirect the message to...' and select the active user hywel@customdomain.co.uk.

That's it, this method provides functionality similar to catch-all,  whilst maintaining the excellent service from Office 365 email.
